[![listview.png](https://s18.postimg.org/stoeqdi6h/listview.png)](https://postimg.org/image/z7dhtmn2d/)

I want to provide code with the latest recycler view that will have powerful, flexible and highly customizable instrument for image loading, caching and displaying. It provides a lot of configuration options and good control over the image loading and caching process.

## Features
* Multithread image loading (async or sync)
* Wide customization of ImageLoader's configuration (thread executors, downloader, decoder, memory and disk cache, display image options, etc.)
* Many customization options for every display image call (stub images, caching switch, decoding options, Bitmap processing and displaying, etc.)
* Image caching in memory and/or on disk (device's file system or SD card)
* Listening loading process (including downloading progress)
* Android 2.0+ support

## Usage

```
"http://site.com/image.png" // from Web
"file:///mnt/sdcard/image.png" // from SD card
"file:///mnt/sdcard/video.mp4" // from SD card (video thumbnail)
"content://media/external/images/media/13" // from content provider
"content://media/external/video/media/13" // from content provider (video thumbnail)
"assets://image.png" // from assets
"drawable://" + R.drawable.img // from drawables (non-9patch images)
```
